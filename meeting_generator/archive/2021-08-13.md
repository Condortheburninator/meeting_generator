- PSA: IsNull is not NullIf. Copying and pasting it in 3 other places doesn't make it turn into nullif either.
##### Reporting Nomenclature revision/standardization
<p>I've geen getting burned frequently following Kevin & Lexen leaving by people not understanding the data in reports. There's a lot of confusion around cases and efficiencies in particular. The most common issues are not knowing the units, or knowing the units, but seeing conflicting data due to different sources. Wherever possible in reports, I'd like to propose switching to a naming convention of: Source, Metric, Unit.</p>

For Example:

- Cases →  (DSI/Netsuite/Filler/Palletizer) (phys/EQ) cases
- Efficiency → (OpInsights/GC) (USL/ME/OEM) Efficiency

<p>Steve Hall has been undertaking the process of updating the storage of PowerBI reports - most things will end up in the Coopersville workspace, rather than in engineering/opinsights. As part of the overhaul, Steve is planning on meeting with report owners for each report and having them add a **metadata sheet** to the report. The metadata sheet will include: Title, Purpose, Author, Sponsor, Target Audience, Data Source(s), Limitations, and general notes. This will become a standard practice for creating reports.</p>

##### Creating Measures for dynamic first/last row values in a Power BI dataset

<br>

```DAX
MeasureName = 
SELECTCOLUMNS(
    TOPN(1,
        Filter('TableName', 'TableName'[ColumnToFilterBy] = "ColumnToFilterBy"),
        'TableName'[ColumnToOrderBy],ASC),
    "ColumnToReturn",[ColumnToReturn])
```

##### C#. Microsoft's recommended syntax for declaring values with _new_ has been updated!

<br>

```c#
Old:     _variable_ = new datatype(value);
Updated: _variable_ = new(value);
//In the case of defining an empty data structure (e.g. List<string>), the syntax is simply new().
Old:     myList = new List<string>();
Updated: myList = new();
```

- grand totals in sql

```sql
SELECT
         [MainAccountId]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtCredit]), '###,###'), '')        AS [AmtCredit]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtDebit]), '###,###'), '')         AS [AmtDebit]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtTransaction]), '###,###'), '')   AS [AmtTransaction]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtReporting]), '###,###'), '')     AS [AmtReporting]

FROM
        [star].[factGeneralLedger]

WHERE
        MONTH([DateAccounting]) = 7
        AND
        [MainAccountId] IN (405104, 405114, 405116, 405120, 405122)

GROUP BY
        [MainAccountId]

WITH ROLLUP

ORDER BY
        [MainAccountId] ASC
```

- this is great but it (by default) displays nulls first (see image below)

</br>

```sql
SELECT
         [MainAccountId]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtCredit]), '###,###'), '')        AS [AmtCredit]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtDebit]), '###,###'), '')         AS [AmtDebit]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtTransaction]), '###,###'), '')   AS [AmtTransaction]
        ,NULLIF(FORMAT(SUM([AmtReporting]), '###,###'), '')     AS [AmtReporting]

FROM
        [star].[factGeneralLedger]

WHERE
        MONTH([DateAccounting]) = 7
        AND
        [MainAccountId] IN (405104, 405114, 405116, 405120, 405122)

GROUP BY
        [MainAccountId]

WITH ROLLUP

ORDER BY
        CASE
            WHEN [MainAccountId] IS NULL
            THEN 1
            ELSE 0
         END
        ,[MainAccountId] ASC
```
- you have to write a custom CASE statement in order to sort the output as intended

- MYSQL conveniently (for them) has a handy feature to solve for this natively

```SQL
SELECT
        *

FROM
        creditCard

ORDER BY
        monthlyLimit DESC NULLS LAST
```
