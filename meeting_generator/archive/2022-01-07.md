-I think this is the best way to get and immediately use the auto-incrementing ID you just created by inserting into a table.

  - > "Now Blecharczyk's cofounder and CEO, Brian Chesky, wanted him to turn around and give away $250 million to Airbnb's hard-hit hosts."
  - > "He dove into data and computer models, analyzing the number of canceled stays, forecasted upcoming cancellations, calculated the amount of revenue lost, and organized hosts by the strictness of their cancellation policies and size (small hosts got top preference). Model in hand, Blecharczyk deployed the $250 million in three weeks. More than 650,000 hosts were paid 25% of their lost reservation income."
  - > "His latest project, City Portal, is a collection of tools and data dashboards meant to mend Airbnb's often fraught relationships with local government leaders."
  - > "He hit upon two key insights. Listings drove demand, and once a city had more than 300 listings, something clicked, and the market would grow on its own. "By looking at the data very carefully, we refocused the problem. We simplified the goal from growing the company across the country to just getting 300 properties in the most important tourist cities." The plan worked. Airbnb's sprouted up in every major US city."
  - > "Ragers, while rare, drew a disproportionate amount of press and attention. Again he dug deep in the data searching for patterns... His analysis revealed that most bashes were thrown by guests under 25 who lived near the property and booked the home last minute. (Airbnb stayed mum on other factors). Airbnb created an algorithm to block high-risk rentals and set up a policy that puts restrictions on the properties that folks under 25 can rent. Parties have since declined."
