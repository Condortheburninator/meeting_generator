- how do you handle decimals in SQL?
    - DECIMAL data type?
    - leave as a number
    - * 100 and call it out as a percentage?

> Up until 2012, the number of articles in most Wikipedias was growing “organically” - that is, human authors were writing them. Then, in 2012, a bot called Lsjbot was launched. It started writing articles for Swedish and Cebuano Wikipedias with lightning speed. Within a few years, it took these two editions into 2nd and 3rd place.

> You might ask: but why specifically Swedish and Cebuano? It turns out that Sverker Johansson, the programmer who created Lsjbot, is Swedish. And Cebuano is the native language of his wife. Each Wikipedia edition has rules on what articles are accepted and whether bots can write them. The Swedish and Cebuano Wikipedia communities evidently decided to allow submissions from bots, but at some point around 2017 - 2018, this decision was reversed. As can be seen in the chart, the rate of new articles has considerably flattened out.

> The articles written by Lsjbot are typically very short and factual and have been criticized for lacking meaningful content. So we’re still some way away from quality Wikipedia content being automatically generated by bots.
