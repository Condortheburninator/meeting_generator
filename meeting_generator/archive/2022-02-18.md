    - > Before DARWIN, context switching between different tools was required, and cooperation was difficult to achieve, resulting in hampered productivity. Another pre-DARWIN issue was tool fragmentation due to past usage and personal preferences, resulting in information fragmentation, the inability to quickly identify prior work, and the difficulty of sharing results with partners. Furthermore, complying with LinkedIn‚Äôs privacy and security regulations for each tool, mainly when utilized locally, resulted in an ever-increasing overhead.

    - > Open-source code commits show that code that would have fixed this vulnerability was written as early as January 13th and uploaded to the Wormhole GitHub repository on the day of the attack. Just hours later, the vulnerability was exploited by the hacker, suggesting that the updates had not yet been applied to the production application. $250 million goes bye bye. -Brenton
