    - all about the video game team fortress 2 bot crisis
    - really interesting episode and insight into valve's culture of zero organisational hierarchy
    - all desks come with wheels and people can literally move to a new project if they want
    - [valve employee handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)

> "And there's literally this infographic where they show you how to pop out the wheels of your desk to ditch whatever project you're not interested in and wheel over toward the project that just won you over. And Valve employees are encouraged to find their own assignments. Like, you could work on Steam, you could work on VR stuff, you could work on TF2."

> "And Jessica says, with Valve, of course, you never know for sure, but what that very well might mean is that TF2's fate is actually just up to how interested the engineers at Valve are in solving its problems. That no matter how beloved it is by its playerbase, TF2 just isn't shiny anymore."

#### **:bar_chart: chart review**

- [:bar_chart: icu beds are running out again](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-covid-19-hospitalizations-approach-a-peak-as-delta-variant-spreads-11630155627?st=yatq47uc5558iay&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter&mod=e2twg)
    - interesting use of legend to call out y axis
    - most charts show >= 50% of ice bed utilisation for a preventable illness

> This is a 24-hour snapshot for a day in the life of Americans. Each ring represents an activity with a color. More dots means a greater percentage of people doing the respective activity during a certain time of day.

> If you start at the top of the circle, you‚Äôll be at 9:00am when most people who work are already working. Move clockwise, and you see the flows of the day. People break for lunch at noon, get off work around 5:00pm, shift to dinner and then relax. Most people are sleeping by midnight but a small percentage of people are work at night.

> Focus on the inside rings versus the outer rings for a rough comparison between work life and home life, each with its own responsibilities.

- Lucidchart changed their icon
- DAX psa: best practice is to fully qualify columns and to never fully qualify measures. As it turns out, measures being part of a specific table is just for ease of navigation. Behind the scenes they're not associated with any table in particular, they're just a part of the model.
