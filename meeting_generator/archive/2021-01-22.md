#### **general news/updates**
- [Video: Why the liquids in Half-Life Alyx look so dang good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XWxsJKpYYI&list=WL&index=8)
    - how game developers shade objects in video games
    - [in-depth snarky reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/kpr07e/why_the_liquids_in_halflife_alyx_look_so_dang_good/)

- also, stop deleting the last octothorpe you heathens.
- I always forget what octothorpes are. Sounds like a prehistoric dinosaur octopus.

#

#### **github structure**
- separate SQL databases?
    - this would help with security
        - painful to manage though
#

#### **user updates**

##### Asad
- SQL Loops don't reset variables declared within the loop between iterations
- Project documentation folders: S/F drive for PM documents, Teams for user manuals?
- IS project documentation should not just be an IS task
- "Customer must not (and is not licensed to): Work around any technical limitations in a Product." - Literally Microsoft

##### Lexen
 - Stored Procedure Automatic Tracking: Advantages and Disadvantages
 - Overseer Display
 - Machine Learning models considered usable for VTIS1
     - Next targets will be the remaining VTIS', then membranes
 - Working with 3D displays

``` SQL

CREATE FUNCTION GETONLYDATE()
RETURNS DATETIME
AS
BEGIN
	RETURN(SELECT CONVERT(DATETIME, CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE())))
END

GO;

UPDATE
	Orders set ShippedDate = dbo.getonlydate()  
WHERE
	OrderID = 1;

SELECT 
	 OrderDate
	,RequiredDate
	,ShippedDate  
FROM 
	orders   
WHERE 
	OrderDate = dbo.GETONLYDATE();
