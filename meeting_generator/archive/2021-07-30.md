-Reporting Nomenclature revision/standardization
<p>I've geen getting burned frequently following Kevin & Lexen leaving by people not understanding the data in reports. There's a lot of confusion around cases and efficiencies in particular. The most common issues are not knowing the units, or knowing the units, but seeing conflicting data due to different sources. Wherever possible in reports, I'd like to propose switching to a naming convention of: Source, Metric, Unit.</p>

For Example:

- Cases →  (DSI/Netsuite/Filler/Palletizer) (phys/EQ) cases
- Efficiency → (OpInsights/GC) (USL/ME/OEM) Efficiency
