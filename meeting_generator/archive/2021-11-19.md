- [NETFLIX: A LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STREAMING SERVICE ON THE PLANET](https://www.theverge.com/22787426/netflix-cdn-open-connect)
    - > "Open Connect is Netflix‚Äôs in-house content distribution network specifically built to deliver its TV shows and movies. Started in 2012, the program involves Netflix giving internet service providers physical appliances that allow them to localize traffic. These appliances store copies of Netflix content to create less strain on networks by eliminating the number of channels that content has to pass through to reach the user trying to play it."
    - > Most major streaming services rely on third-party content delivery networks (CDNs) to pass along their videos, which is why Netflix‚Äôs server network is so unique. Without a system like Open Connect or a third-party CDN in place, a request for content by an ISP has to ‚Äúgo through a peering point and maybe transit four or five other networks until it gets to the origin, or the place that holds the content,‚Äù Will Law, chief architect of media engineering at Akamai, a major content delivery network, tells The Verge. Not only does that slow down delivery, but it‚Äôs expensive since ISPs may have to pay to access that content.

    - > "To avoid the traffic and fees, Netflix ships copies of its content to its own servers ahead of time. That also helps to prevent Netflix traffic from choking network demand during peak hours of streaming."

    - > "We, Open Connect, bring a copy of Bridgerton at the closest point to your internet service provider ‚Äî in some cases, right inside your internet service provider‚Äôs network ‚Äî and that basically avoids the burden of the internet service provider having to go get it and transfer it through all these servers on the internet over to you,‚Äù Haspilaire tells The Verge.

    - > "The thing that Netflix is most concerned with is delivering a good viewing experience regardless of how bad your ISP is."

- [Google Staff Squirm as Remote Workers Face Pay Cuts](https://www.wired.com/story/google-remote-work-pay-cuts-big-tech/)
    - > "MILLIONS OF PEOPLE are seemingly ready and willing to take a pay cut to continue working remotely. Sixty-one percent of American workers; four in 10 Londoners; more than a quarter of office workers in the UK. Breathless media reports on the trend cite a lot of statistics, but few have found any people happily slashing their monthly household budgets. In fact, when you look at the major technology companies actually bringing in these remote pay cuts, many employees are choosing to cut and run."
    - > "He wants to continue working for the company remotely, but the pay cut he‚Äôd have to take to do so is equivalent to losing four years of pay increases."
    - > "Laura de Vesine, a former Google engineer, didn‚Äôt wait to find out. She left Google earlier this year when she was told her pay would be cut by 25 percent. ‚ÄúThere was a discussion about moving our team to North Carolina, and that was originally floated as a 15 percent pay cut,‚Äù she says. At first, she thought that was reasonable, then they announced it would actually be 25. ‚ÄúThe bait and switch was very upsetting,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd once I was angry about it, I started questioning why there was even a 15 percent cut. What is it about my work that is somehow less valuable in a different location?‚Äù

- [Zillow's home-buying debacle shows how hard it is to use AI to value real estate](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/tech/zillow-ibuying-home-zestimate/index.html)
    - > "In February, Zillow appeared so confident in its ability to use artificial intelligence to estimate the value of homes that it announced a new option: for certain homes, its so-called "Zestimate" would also represent an initial cash offer from the company to purchase the property."
    - > "The decision, announced last week, marks a stunning defeat for Zillow. The real estate listing company took a $304 million inventory write-down in the third quarter, which it blamed on having recently purchased homes for prices that are higher than it thinks it can sell them. The company saw its stock plunge and it now plans to cut 2,000 jobs, or 25% of its staff."

- [progamming : hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
    - > identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its intention or kind, and in some dialects its type.

    - > In Systems Hungarian notation, the prefix encodes the actual data type of the variable. For example:
        - > lAccountNum : variable is a long integer ("l");
        - > arru8NumberList : variable is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers ("arru8");
        - > bReadLine(bPort,&arru8NumberList) : function with a byte-value return code.
        - > strName : Variable represents a string ("str") containing the name, but does not specify how that string is implemented.
    - > Apps Hungarian notation strives to encode the logical data type rather than the physical data type; in this way, it gives a hint as to what the variable's purpose is, or what it represents.
        - > rwPosition : variable represents a row ("rw");
        - > usName : variable represents an unsafe string ("us"), which needs to be "sanitized" before it is used (e.g. see code injection and cross-site scripting for examples of attacks that can be caused by using raw user input)
        - > szName : variable is a zero-terminated string ("sz"); this was one of Simonyi's original suggested 1prefixes.

        - L1 CasePacker had 13,000 stops over the past 43 days. About 12 stops per hour.
        - Questions about data validation. I went out and measured stops and time between stops. I saw 10-13 stops per hour which would confirm some of the findings.
