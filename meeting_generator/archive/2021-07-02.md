#### **general news/updates**
- [datawrapper | Data Vis Dispatch, June 22](https://blog.datawrapper.de/data-vis-dispatch-june-22-2021/)
    - what charts work, what don't? It's a good reminder, at least for me, about what seems obvious vs. what isn't.
- [docking station issues](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/o50ewk/anyone_else_actually_miss_laptop_docking_stations/)

> This exactly. As hardware becomes increasingly more software-defined, you start to wonder what you're going to get when you plug two devices together. USB-C is the absolute worst for this. Depending on what magic numbers cross the cables in the instant of connection, you could have USB, HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, 20V power or any combination thereof.

> With active cables now a requirement, and a race to the bottom in cheap circuitry, it's now very possible for the cables themselves to silently fail - go back 5 years and ask yourself, have you ever seen a display cable fail? If yes, it would have been physically damaged. I worked for a startup and by the time I moved on I had a growing pile of failed USB-C to HDMI/DisplayPort cables. Even the expensive Apple USB-C->HDMI adapters had a 25% failure rate.

> Even worse, USB-C, in its strive to be the one and only connector doing all these functions, simply doesn't have the bandwidth to literally do it all. It's a jack-of-all, master-of-none - you can run a fairly average ultrabook with 2x 1080p screens without serious problems, but if you want higher refresh rates or resolutions, nobody can actually tell you beforehand if the setup will work. There are no concrete numbers that will reliably tell you this system can output the signals you want, and this dock can split them out into the screens you want. Yes, I've run into exactly this trying to drive a pair of 1440p screens off a ThinkPad with a genuine Lenovo dock.

> Proprietary docking stations and port replicators are a form of lock-in. However, they aren't software-defined - they are hardware-defined. Each pin from the docking port goes to a pin on the replicator. There is almost no way for it to fail without you noticing physical damage. I do have the situation where I have two different brands of laptop I may want to use - my BYOD Lenovo and my work-issued Dell, so a USB-C dock covers this use case. However, there is still a proprietary aspect - the power buttons used by Lenovo and Dell docks are not compatible with each other. It's an infuriating setup. Thankfully I don't have to use my Dell much. But I definitely miss having the same docking setup I had on my ThinkPad X220.
- [sql | unique key vs. primary key](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-primary-key-and-unique-key)
    - unique key is often used to check for duplicates
        - "hey, it looks like you already have an account with us..."
        - might we have any examples at fairlife?

- [intern at hbo max accidently sent out a test email](https://twitter.com/i/events/1405955843493826560?s=21)

> Dear Intern, I was using my desktop calendar to make a monthly note of when I started my menstrual period, but after several months I realized I was making that note on a calendar I shared with all of my colleagues company wide. I was 37 years old.

> As an intern I dropped a table in a prod database. I decided to resign immediately, packed up my stuff and went to tell my boss. She was talking to the CEO of the company so got terrified and went back to my spot to find out connection expired before it could run.

- first CROSS JOIN example
