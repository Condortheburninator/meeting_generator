- [progamming : hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
    - > identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its intention or kind, and in some dialects its type.

    - > In Systems Hungarian notation, the prefix encodes the actual data type of the variable. For example:
        - > lAccountNum : variable is a long integer ("l");
        - > arru8NumberList : variable is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers ("arru8");
        - > bReadLine(bPort,&arru8NumberList) : function with a byte-value return code.
        - > strName : Variable represents a string ("str") containing the name, but does not specify how that string is implemented.
    - > Apps Hungarian notation strives to encode the logical data type rather than the physical data type; in this way, it gives a hint as to what the variable's purpose is, or what it represents.
        - > rwPosition : variable represents a row ("rw");
        - > usName : variable represents an unsafe string ("us"), which needs to be "sanitized" before it is used (e.g. see code injection and cross-site scripting for examples of attacks that can be caused by using raw user input)
        - > szName : variable is a zero-terminated string ("sz"); this was one of Simonyi's original suggested 1prefixes.

- :syringe: data colloquium health check :syringe:
    - are we liking this format?
    - do we still find value?
    - any ideas for improvement?
    - random order of updaters?

- Important notes on learning github:
  - If you create a new branch and make changes, you must COMMIT. Changes will not show up on the branch UNTIL you commit
  - I assumed that when you do a git pull that the remote and local branch automatically fast forward merge if they have the same branch name. This was not the case.
