- [article - A Fundamental Guide to SQL Query Optimization](https://tvkoushik.medium.com/mastering-sql-query-optimization-622cc6addef2)
    - Prefer UNION ALL to UNION
    - Use TRUNCATE instead of DELETE to delete all rows in a table
        - The TRUNCATE statement removes all rows from a table by dropping the table and recreating a new table with the same name. This performs better than using DELETE, which performs multiple transactions to delete all rows.
    - Drop index before loading bulk data
        - Inserting thousands of rows into a table having an index slows down the ingestion of data.
    - Avoid too many subquery or CTE joins
        - A solution to this is to load the data or all the subqueries/CTE’s into intermediate/temp tables and then use those tables to do the join, as this doesn’t involve holding in memory and uses the pre-computed data available in disk via the intermediate/temp tables to compute the query.
            - This was something which helped me cut down the query execution time from 7+ hours to just 10 mins. That’s just ridiculous !!!!!
    - Use Same Datatype on JOIN and WHERE Clauses
    - Make sure your queries take advantage of INDEXING
    - Avoid correlated subqueries unless required
    - Use Equals Operator (=) instead of LIKE clause
        - ‘=’ and LIKE clauses are used to match rows having a particular value. The main difference between the two is that the LIKE operator is used for matching wildcards such as % to search for partial strings, whereas the equals operator “=” looks for exact matches.
            - If you have to choose between the two, always prefer the equals operator (“=”), as it makes use of indexed columns which makes it faster in searching through the value, but if the search requirement is about searching on a particular pattern then LIKE can be used.
    - Avoid concatenation of columns in WHERE clause
        - Avoid
            ~~~SQL
                SELECT
                         name
                        ,surname

                FROM
                        class

                WHERE
                        name || surname = ‘Alexmercer’

            ~~~
        - Prefer

            ~~~SQL
                SELECT
                         name
                        ,surname

                FROM
                        class

                WHERE
                        name = ‘Alex’
                        AND
                        surname = 'mercer'

            ~~~
    - Avoid SELECT DISTINCT for large tables
