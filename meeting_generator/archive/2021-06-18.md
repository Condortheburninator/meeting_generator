#### **general news/updates**
- [mobile vs. digital vs. print](https://blog.datawrapper.de/the-philadelphia-inquirer/)

> "John has several strategies to optimize the experience on different devices. He starts by making a chart on the smallest size and then moves to bigger formats. “If it doesn’t work on mobile, it’s pointless,” he says."

- [python potentially becoming 5x faster](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2021/06/python-made-faster-use-in-finance)

> Van Rossum's presentation, posted on Github, explains how he hopes to bring this about, including an adaptative bytecode interpreter, optimizing the frame stack, and 'zero overhead' exception handling. If these changes double Python's speed, Van Rossum said subsequent changes could include a stable ABI (application binary interface) or machine code generation to speed Python up even further. 

> Van Rossum isn't commenting on the likely implications of the changes to Python's finance users. However, given that C++ is over 100 times faster than Python, it's unlikely to make Python applicable for use in trading systems any time soon.

- [ai researcher firing at google follow-up](https://www.wired.com/story/google-timnit-gebru-ai-what-really-happened/)

> "...she and Buolamwini published evidence that services offered by companies including IBM and Microsoft that attempted to detect the gender of faces in photos were nearly perfect at recognizing white men, but highly inaccurate for Black women."
