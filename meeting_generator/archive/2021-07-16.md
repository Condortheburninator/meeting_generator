> The chart above looks like a bar chart — but to create it, I used a Datawrapper scatter plot. It offers the greatest flexibility of all Datawrapper chart types. I mostly used features from the Annotate tab, such as annotation, highlight ranges, and custom lines. To calculate the horizontal “bars,” I wrote a tiny script that you can run in the console of your browser. I then pasted the results in the textfield of our “custom lines and areas” feature.

```r

const years = [2098,2088,2078,2068,2059,2049,2041,2034,2027,2024]; 
const age = [9,19,29,39,49,59,69,79,89,99]; 
let text =''; 
for (let i = years.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {text += `2021.2 + ${age[i]} + ${years[i] - 0.2} + ${age[i]} + @width:10px @color:#fff \n`;} 
console.log(text);

#### **python vs. julia**

<br>

| python philosopy | julia philosophy |
| :---             | :---            |
|<br>Beautiful is better than ugly. <br> Explicit is better than implicit.<br> Simple is better than complex.<br> Complex is better than complicated.<br> Flat is better than nested.<br> Sparse is better than dense.<br> Readability counts.<br> Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.<br> Although practicality beats purity. | We are greedy: we want more.<br> We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. <br> We want the speed of C  with the dynamism of Ruby. <br> We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. <br> We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. <br> Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy.<br> We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

- Dynamic and static types
>Python is 100% dynamically typed. This means that the program decides at runtime whether a variable is a float or an integer, for example.

>While this is extremely beginner-friendly, it also introduces a whole host of possible bugs. This means that you need to test Python code in all possible scenarios — which is quite a dumb task that takes a lot of time.

>Since the Julia-creators also wanted it to be easy to learn, Julia fully supports dynamical typing. But in contrast to Python, you can introduce static types if you like — in the way they are present in C or Fortran, for example.

#### Machine Learning Aimbot - Death of the FPS Genre?

https://www.itechpost.com/articles/106272/20210707/next-generation-aimbot-uses-ai-revealed-new-cheat-program-active.htm

<p>A machine learning based aimbot hack was developed in Python. The hack works on any game, on any platform which allows use of a capture card. Functionally, it works by 'learning' what enemies look like by analyzing data in a GPU, then sends inputs to the game via a fake HID. In short, it doesn't touch the game directly, so cheat detection based on detecting injection doesn't work. The inputs it sends also don't show up as anomalous - it's like trying to detect if someone is pressing keys with their fingers or with a robotic hand. In short, it's a universal hack that's virtually undetectable. Activision personally made it their mission to take down the discord server where the original cheat was being distributed, but new versions have already been developed.

Although this style of cheat has been proposed and researched as far back as 2013 (that I know of), the concept was largely held in check by lack of computing power. Now that stronger GPUs are widely available, and this form of cheating has been proven possible and effective, Pandora's box is opened for good.</p>
