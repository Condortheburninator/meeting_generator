- [what kind of programming language is SQL?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-transact-sql/1-introduction)

```
Programming languages can be categorized as procedural or declarative. Procedural languages enable you to define a sequence of instructions that the computer follows to perform a task. Declarative languages enable you to describe the output you want, and leave the details of the steps required to produce the output to the execution engine.

SQL supports some procedural syntax, but querying data with SQL usually follows declarative semantics. You use SQL to describe the results you want, and the database engine's query processor develops a query plan to retrieve it. The query processor uses statistics about the data in the database and indexes that are defined on the tables to come up with a good query plan.

- Calculate the distance between two coordinates (lat/long or lat/long/alt): 
    - [.NET GeoCoordinate class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.device.location.geocoordinate?view=netframework-4.8) GeoCoordinate.GetDistanceTo() calculated using the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula), distance as the crow flies, rather than driving distance.
    - [MapQuest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/) Free calculations of driving distance/travel time, standard limitations of using an API
- Validating schemas for user-provided database tables in C#
- PSA: Override your GetHashCode() functions for derived types! The default .GetHashCode() for derived types is a reference comparison.

    - I deleted the whole dynamics data model (deleted the resource from azure) and was able to have it back up and running in 30 minutes.
