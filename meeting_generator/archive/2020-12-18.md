##### brenton
- General curses. Pro tip: When you create an upgraded package in github don't just reverse the name. Flask-Bootstrap -> Bootstrap-Flask
- If you come from Flask-Bootstrap, looking for an alternative that supports Bootstrap 4, well, then you are in the right place.
Bootstrap-Flask originated as a fork of Flask-Bootstrap, but some APIs were changed, deleted and improved, some bugs were fixed, and on top of all that, some new macros were added.
