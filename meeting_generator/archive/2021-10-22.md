- [The Frustration with Productivity Culture](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/office-space/the-frustration-with-productivity-culture)

> Instead of demanding that employees individually produce more, we should instead seek systems that produce more given the same number of employees. This shift might seem subtle but its impact can be enormous, as it frees individuals from the complexity of optimizing output all on their own, and defuses the psychological torment of pitting the personal versus the professional.

> To effectively discuss these workplace issues, we must be careful to collapse the definition of ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù to its precise meaning of maximizing output. It is exactly these optimization efforts that I suggest moving away from the individual and back toward systems. Critically, this specificity retains knowledge workers‚Äô general need to do their job well. Much of the professional self-improvement literature that is often hastily summarized as being about ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù really is not, in the sense that it focusses less on increasing your output above all else and more on nuanced goals, such as reducing stress through better organization, making smarter decisions about your time, being a good leader, or producing higher-quality results.

> We should strive to be good at our jobs‚Äîto work deeply, to be reliable, to lead with vision. But, if our employers need more output for each unit of input they employ, we should be more comfortable in replying that, although we understand their predicament, solving it is not really our problem.

- [easiest things you can do for the environment](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcasts#)
    1. fill up / keep your car tyres inflated
    2. good seals on your windows
    3. led bulbs
    4. eat less and eat less meat
    5. keep your thermostat colder in the winter and warmer in the summer.
        - wear a sweater!

- solution to the :duck: curve? - utilising evs to power your house 
    - utilise evs to offset peak demand and have them charge for the rest of the evening
    - [wired: No, You Can‚Äôt Power Your House With Your Electric Car](https://www.wired.com/story/no-you-cant-power-your-house-with-your-electric-car/)
        - we need a fully connected grid so as the east coast sun sets we can send in power from AZ

> For one thing, any house hoping to use power from the car in its driveway must be able to disconnect from the grid, which requires specialized hardware.

> Also, to convert the battery‚Äôs DC power into the AC goodness running through the grid, the car or its charger needs an inverter. You need the software to tell a car when to discharge its power, and when to hoard it. And you have to address concerns of degradation: Extra demands on batteries can limit their useful lifespan.
