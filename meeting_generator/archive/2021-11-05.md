    - fairlife-script_manager
        - Moved from Window Scheduler to Linx Crontab
        - First script running is bay data pull every 15 min
        - Second script will be a temporary tank level email to 3rd party for lactose loadouts (every 4 hours) *Grrrr python versioning*
    - fairlife-portal_app (Dope collab with Jon R.)
        - Lactose loadout haulers need to see tank level to know when to pickup
        - They are currently using a HMI hooked up in our server room that requires an old version of IE to access through a web browser
        - New app will be host on Azure using Linux and MySQL (wayyy cheaper than going Windows and SQL Server)

    - [change data capture](https://rockset.com/blog/change-data-capture-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/)
        - > Change data capture (CDC) is the process of recognising when data has been changed in a source system so a downstream process or system can action that change. A common use case is to reflect the change in a different target system so that the data in the systems stay in sync.
    - push vs. pull methodology
    - change data capture mechanisms:
        - row versioning
