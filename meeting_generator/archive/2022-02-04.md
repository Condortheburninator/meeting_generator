- [When you try and hide security patches in your "version update"](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916111/wormhole-hack-github-error-325-million-theft-ethereum-solana)
- Open-source code commits show that code that would have fixed this vulnerability was written as early as January 13th and uploaded to the Wormhole GitHub repository on the day of the attack. Just hours later, the vulnerability was exploited by the hacker, suggesting that the updates had not yet been applied to the production application. $250 million goes bye bye. -Brenton

    - > Clockwise currently competes with several other smart calendar and scheduling tools such as Calendly, Doodle, Reclaim and more. Martin says Clockwise differs from other smart calendar platforms because the company is creating a new category it calls ‚Äútime orchestration,‚Äù a modern way to bring schedules together at the organizational level.

    - > I found a Raspberry Pi on my network yesterday. It was plugged in behind a printer stand in an area that's accessible to the public. There's no branding on it and I can't get in with default credentials.
    - > ...Most printer companies have asked us to install their counter software on our servers, but we've had one that just stuck a raspberry pi on the printer and did it themselves. No branding on the raspberry pi, but it was physically attached to the printer with some Velcro tape and the hostname was MFPCOMPANY-Pi.

    - > The I.B.M. research engineer Emerson Pugh is credited with saying ‚ÄúIf the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn‚Äôt.
    - > This ability of humans to build on one another‚Äôs work is precisely why I don‚Äôt believe that running a human-equivalent A.I. program for a hundred years in isolation is a good way to produce major breakthroughs. An individual working in complete isolation can come up with a breakthrough but is unlikely to do so repeatedly; you‚Äôre better off having a lot of people drawing inspiration from one another. They don‚Äôt have to be directly collaborating; any field of research will simply do better when it has many people working in it.
