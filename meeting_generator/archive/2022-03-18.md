- [Data Analytics Marathon: Why Your Organization Must Focus On The Finish](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2022/01/12/data-analytics-marathon-why-your-organization-must-focus-on-the-finish/?sh=7d980ee93c3b)

    - > "You’ll notice I included some percentages in the diagram. Based on my experience, they represent rough estimates for how many companies reach each milestone in the data analytics marathon. Today, I’d estimate 99.8% of companies are collecting data, and a high percentage of these organizations are also preparing reports and visualizing their data on a regular basis."
        - Automate early-stage tasks
        - Narrow the scope
        - Foster a stronger data culture

- [article - The free speech search engine that never was](https://www.vox.com/recode/22981115/duckduckgo-free-speech-privacy-oops)
    - > "DuckDuckGo, the search engine that markets itself as a privacy-first alternative to Google, was no different: On March 9, its CEO Gabriel Weinberg announced that it was going to down-rank sites that spread Russian disinformation."
    - > "Weinberg’s tweet announcing the change generated thousands of comments, many of them from conservative-leaning users who were furious that the company they turned to in order to get away from perceived Big Tech censorship was now the one doing the censoring. It didn’t help that the content DuckDuckGo was demoting and calling disinformation was Russian state media, whose side some in the right-wing contingent of DuckDuckGo’s users were firmly on."
